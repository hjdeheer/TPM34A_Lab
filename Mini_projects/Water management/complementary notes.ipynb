    "Conflicts across the Nile's water uses prompts the need for unbiased decision support.  From Egypt's and Sudan's perspective, the goal is to minimize water shortages, whereas for Ethiopia, the priority is to maximize hydropower generation from the GERD. Therefore, no single objective formulation can maximize performance across all actors.  Due to the conflicting interests of the three countries, we use a many objective optimization problem formulation to find the **Pareto-optimal set**, where one objective cannot improve performance without degrading performance in one or more objectives.  \n",

    "We define the following objectives for the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimize average annual water shortage for Egypt and for Sudan during the horizon of 2022-2042.\n",
    "* Minimize the deficit of a month with the 90$^{th}$ percentile worst deficit. This objective denotes high risk aversion by minimizing the deficit for a catastrophic month for Sudan and Egypt.\n",
    "* Minimize the frequency of months when the water level in the High Aswan Dam (HAD) falls below the minimum hydroenergy production level. This objective reflects Egypt's hydropower generation goals.\n",

    "To find the mult-reservoir, multi-objective control policy for the Nile system, we use **Evolutionary Multi-objective Direct Policy Search [(EMODPS)](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29WR.1943-5452.0000570)** due to its flexibility to simultaneously find policies across many objectives, and its ability to overcome the dimensionality issues encountered when adding more states to the system (*i.e.* multiple reservoirs and streamflow scenarios). We first parameterize the control policy via nonlinear approximators, in this case, we use radial basis functions, due to their flexibility to find the control policy for multiple objectives.  The parameters of the radial basis functions are then optimized using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on their performance across all the objectives of the system.  \n",

    "## Task 1. Visualize Pareto optimal trade-offs across multiple conflicting water uses in the Nile River Basin\n",
    "\n",
    "The data/baseline_results.csv contains the Pareto-optimal set of solutions for the Nile goals summarized in the table above.  The data is organized in columns which include the decision variables (values assigned to free parameters of the policy function) and the last six columns of the dataframe are the corresponding objective values.  Each row in the dataframe is a different Pareto-optimal policy.  In order to visualize the tradeoffs you first need to split the results into policies and objective values, once you isolate the objectives, you can visualize the tradeoffs across them.  A popular visualization strategy for  trade-off analysis across many objectives are [parallel coordinates](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636793). With parallel coordinates, each vertical axis represents the values for a particular objective.  The direction of preference is fixed across all objectives such that a line on top of all axis would represent the 'ideal' solution.  If two lines cross, it indicates that a tradeoff was encountered, in other words, it denotes high performance in one objective and low performance in another objective. From the data, discover and discuss the trade-offs across objectives and generate a visualization of the tradeoffs."
