    "# `Application: Primary school performance` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab session you will use ML to predict which primary schools perform well and which do not. The quality of primary school is deemed to impact the children's future employment outcomes, especially for students from lower-income families (see [reference](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1016/S0147-9121(01)20039-9/full/html)). Therefore, **the ministry of education** expects all schools to meet certain performance criteria.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measuring school performance** is notoriously difficult. In lab session 3, you have developed ML models to predict the share of students adviced to go to higher education (HAVO, VWO). However, it would be **naive** to equate such an indicator to school performance. This would ignore self-selection effects. For instance, wealthier families tend to live together in wealthy neighbourhood. Moreover, wealthier families may be able to afford extra education (e.g. saturday morning math classes) which less well-off families are not able to. As a result, the share of students adviced to go to higher education may be higher in wealthier neigbourhoods not because of the better school, but because of opportunities to have extra education. School advices thus do not necessarily reflect the performance of schools. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, it is evident that - all else being equal - a good performing school has a larger share of students leaving with advice for higher education than a bad performing school. In other words, based on behavioural intuition (and theory) we can expect school performance to impact on the share of school leaver with an advice for higher education. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "School performance is latent; we do not measure it directly. But, using the models developed in lab session 3 we can predict the **expected** share of school leavers with an advice for higher education. We can compare this expectation with the observed share. The difference between the two may, at least partially, be explained by the school performance. In other words, if the expected share is much higher than the observed share, the school might not perform well. The figure below shows this conceptual model.<br>\n",
    "![conceptual_model](data/conceptual_model.jpg)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the limited direct data on school performance, the ministry of education would like to get your advice on the following two points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ministry of education has the capacity to do full-fledged assessments of just 10 schools. Can you provide a list of 10 schools to assess with priority?\n",
    "1. Schools receive extra funding for each student with a non-native Dutch language, so-called NOAT2 students. The extra funding should enable schools to allocate more resources to the teaching NOAT2 students, while not leaving other students (called NOAT1) worse off. In other words, the extra funding should mitigate the impact from NOAT2 students on the share of school leavers with an advice for higher education. The ministry would like to know whether the current funding is sufficient to achieve this goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data**\n",
    "For this assignment you have access to two data sets:\n",
    "* The school advice data set of lab session 3 [link](data/school_data.csv). Similar as in lab session 3 the buurt features are expressed as shares of the buurt population (for example, the number of women in the buurt [count] is converted into the share of women in the buurt [%]).\n",
    "* NOAT data [link](data/NOAT.csv) <br>. This data provide the number of pupils that are Dutch native speakers (NOAT1_STUDENTS), and the number of pupils that are non native Dutch speakers (NOAT2_STUDENTS).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tasks and grading**\n",

    "    1. Load the school data and the NOAT data.\n",
    "    1. Compute the share of NOAT1 students and the share of NOAT2 students in each school.\n",
    "    1. Merge the computed shares of NOAT1 and NOAT2 students in the school data. (Note that the NOAT data does not exist for some school in the school data, do **NOT** drop observations for these schools, and replace nan values by 0.).\n",
    "1. **Prepare the data** [1 pnt]\n",
    "    1. Encode categorical variables ('DENOMINATION' and 'SPECIES_PO').\n",
    "    1. Select the 30 most relevant variables for prediction. (hint: use those features that most strongly correlate with the target: SHARE_HIGH).\n",
    "    1. Split the data into a train and a test set.\n",
    "    1. Scale the data using sklearn's StandardScaler.\n",

    "1. **Extra funding for NOAT2 students** [1 pnt]\n",
    "    1. Explain why the question of the ministry regarding the adequacy of the current funding for NOAT2 **cannot** be answered using ML (or at least not the ML taught in this course), and the provided data. <br>\n",
